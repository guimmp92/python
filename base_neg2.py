"""
In base -2, integers are represented in sequences of bits in the following way. Bits are
ordered from the least to the most significant. Sequence B of N bits represents the
number: sum{ B[i]*(-2)^i for i = 0..N-1 }. The empty sequence represents 0.

Note that such a representation is suitable for both positive and negative integers.

Write a function that, give a 0-indexed A array of M bits, containing a sequence
representing some integer X, return the shortest sequence of bits representing -X.

For example, given A = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] (X=9), the solution should return [1, 1, 0, 1]
(-X=-9). Given A = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1] (X=-23), the solution should return
[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1] (-X=23).

For negative b, by the way, everything just flips, and the invariant becomes:
0 >= r > b.
