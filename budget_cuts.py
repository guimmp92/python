"""
The awards committee had planned to give n research grants this year, out of a its total
yearly budget. However, the budget was reduced to b dollars. The committee members has
decided to affect the minimal number of highest grants, by applying a maximum cap c on
all grants: every grant that was planned to be higher than c will now be c dollars.
Help the committee to choose the right value of c that would make the total sum of
grants equal to the new budget.

Given an array of grants g and a new budget b, explain and code an efficient method to
find the cap c. Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.

Example:

grants 10 30 50 70 120 150
total requested 430
budget 240

cumsum 10 40 90 160 280 430
final grants 10 30 50 70 40 40
so c = 40
